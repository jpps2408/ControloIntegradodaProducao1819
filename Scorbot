This is the page where the group 13 will put the videos and the developed code 
of the Scorbot performing the pick and place and full assembly of a part.

Besides, code related to the Thingspeak will also be published here. It will provide insight on the number of parts produced, the number of parts under production
and whether the robot is malfunctioning and requires human assistance.
